# PongProject
Welcome to the Pong Game Project! This is a simple and fun project developed as a coding practice to recreate the classic Pong game with Java. Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, and its simplicity makes it an excellent starting point for learning game development. The project is based on the tutorial by Bro Code (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLirZqJFKPE).
## How to Play
- Player 1 (Blue Paddle) controls the left paddle using the 'W' key to move up and the 'S' key to move down.
- Player 2 (Red Paddle) controls the right paddle using the up arrow key to move up and the down arrow key to move down.
- The game will start after launching it, and the ball will move at a steady pace.
- Use the paddles to hit the ball and prevent it from passing your side of the screen.
- Score points by making the ball go beyond your opponent's paddle.
- The game will display the score of each player at the top of the screen.
- The ball speed will increase after each succeeding pass.
